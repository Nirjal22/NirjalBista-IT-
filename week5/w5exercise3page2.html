	<h1>What is Web Design?</h1>
	<p>Web design refers to the design of websites that are displayed on the internet. It usually 
	refers to the user experience aspects of website development rather than software 
	development. Web design used to be focused on designing websites for desktop 
	browsers; however, since the mid-2010s, design for mobile and tablet browsers has 
	become ever-increasingly important.</p>
